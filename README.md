TexLoader
=========

An api to turn a tex expression into a graphic.

Inside html, all data inside of the <eq> tags are converted into tex images.
To run, simply load the library (closure or non closure depending on your usage)
and run

```js
haodev.tex.convertEquations();
```

to convert all the <eq> tags into the corresponding images.
